//! In-memory shared state synced with Redis.
//!
//! `SharedState` wraps the operation state in `Arc<RwLock<...>>` so that all
//! background automation tasks can read state concurrently, and writes
//! (credential publishing, result processing) are serialized.
//!
//! State is loaded from Redis at startup and updated incrementally as results
//! arrive. Dedup sets are persisted to Redis so they survive orchestrator restarts.
